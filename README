aaisp-quota is a simple script for getting and parsing the remaining quota for
an Andrews & Arnold Home::1 account.  It needs to be run from a system
connected to the Home::1 line, and uses the interface described at
<https://support.aa.net.uk/Home::1>.

month-remaining works out the percentage of the month that's left, so you can
readily compare to the percentage of your quota remaining.

Prerequisites:

The script relies on having access to the following utilities:

- jq, available in many distributions' "jq" packages, or from
  <https://github.com/stedolan/jq>
- curl, available in all good distributions' "curl" packages
- numfmt, available in all good distributions' "coreutils" or similar packages
- bash, almost certainly available in a "bash" distribution, if you're not
  using it right now

Installation:

Just copy the scripts somewhere in your path, or invoke them by specifying the
path directly, or run `sudo make install`.  The makefile isn't doing anything
clever, it's just there for convenience.
